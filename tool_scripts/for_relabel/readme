You need to cd into the all_cfgs folder, and then conduct the corresponding perl script.
For example, you want to create labelled folder for those not labelling 
perl ../tool_scripts/for_relabel/relabel.pl

1. relabel.pl:

perl ../tool_scripts/for_relabel/relabel.pl

you will get a file "nolabel.dat". If not, that means all folders with labelled subfolders.
if "nolabel.dat" appears, you have better to check it first.
Then set some parameters in the relabel.pl. 

my $max4relabel = 2;# how many cfgs you want to use in labelled folder
my $lowerbound = 0.05;#below which not lebelled
conduct this script again
perl ../tool_scripts/for_relabel/relabel.pl
You will get labelled folders for all dirs.

2. cfg2QEinput.pl:
perl ../tool_scripts/for_relabel/cfg2QEinput.pl

All cfg files in labelled folders will be used to create QE input files.


3. sh4QEinput.pl:
perl ../tool_scripts/for_relabel/sh4QEinput.pl

Make sbatch files for all QE input file, and then submit them.
You need to set the following in sh4QEinput.pl:


my $submitJobs = "yes";#only check how many labelled cfg files, then decide how 

#for your sh file
my %sbatch_para = (
            nodes => 1,#how many nodes for your qe job
            ntasks_per_node => 12,
            partition => "debug",#which partition you want to use
            pwPath => "/opt/QEGCC_MPICH4.0.3/bin/pw.x", #qe executable          
            mpiPath => "/opt/mpich-4.0.3/bin/mpiexec" #mpipath          
            );

4. makenpy4all.pl:
perl ../tool_scripts/for_relabel/makenpy4all.pl

Convert all sout files into npy, then you will get all_npy_cfgs folder. Move all_npy_cfgs folder to the path as all_npy folder is located!

Do the standalone or do the dpgen again.
